## Welcome to our section of books!

Every week we share a new book on our stories on Instagram. These are book that we have personally read (in English) and therefore we want to share our thoughts, what we liked about them, the highlights and also if we found any challenges with the language - considering we are not English native speakers. 

If you cannot follow the stories right away, don't worry! You can check this page every week or check the Highlights section on our [Instagram Account](https://www.instagram.com/the_expatmagazine/). 

As always, we encourage you to share also your thoughts and, why not, also share the books that you read and found interesting.
