Our focus is the help any expat to have a even better experience while living abroad.

We are always looking for volunteers who want to share their stories, tips and suggestions, so If you want to share your experience with us and our readers, we are happy to host your article!

> Drop us a mail at _info@thexpatmagazine.com_ and tell us a bit about yourself, what topic you would like to write about or just send the article and we will review it. A good tip is to take a look at the existing articles on our website and come up with new topics. There are no strict rules for writing, but just some basic ones :

1. Article must be in english
2. Articles cannot contain offences against the country or bad, offensive and personal review.
3. Try to provide links as references when necessary (e.g. if providing bureaucracy informations).
4. We do not accept articles that are, clearly, with a political standing.

If you can provide us also a short bio, your website and or social media accounts, we will add you as author on our [authors page](https://www.thexpatmagazine.com/authors/).
