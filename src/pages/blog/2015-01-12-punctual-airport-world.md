The first airport from London to top the rank is Luton, among the first 10 but far away from the performance of the best airport. The second place is taken by theÂ **_Brussels South Charleroi Airport_** at 93.1% (**Ryanair** flies also from here) Â and **Berlin Schoenefeld** at 92.3% of scheduled flights.

**Atlanta** is the most busiest airline in the World, but ranks only 12th while **Dubai** is 14th. If we look at the largest Hub then germans confirms their leadership in punctuality, with Munich Airport the most punctual at 89% of flights arrived in time. **Tokyo** and **Seattle** follow the German Hub.

Surprises also in the airlines companies, withÂ **Latvia's airBaltic** outperforming all others at 94.9%. Â Second Â **_Hawaiian Airlines_** at 92.3% and third _**Austrian Airlines**_ at 90%.

These are the others airlines companies in the rank :

1. Austrian Airlines (90.0 %)
2. Iberia (89.7%)
3. KLM (89.4%)
4. Saudi Arabian Airlines (89.4%)
5. SAS (89.1%)
6. Japan Airlines (88.8%)

8. Alaska Airlines (88.5%).

Finally, theÂ  Norwegian Air Shuttle was named the most punctual low-cost carrier, with almost nine out of 10 flights sticking to schedule. Followed by Â the asian Thai AirAsia and EasyJet.
