The Â <a href="https://www.oag.com" target="_blank"><strong>OAG</strong></a>, the the UK based aviation data monitor, released a press with a study that determines the **most punctual airport in the World**, and the most punctual airlines.

Surprising the first place on the list is taken by the small Hub of _**Bristol**_ in the UK. The Hub hosts flights in Europe and Africa and has the 94.4 % of the flights arrived within 15 minutes from the scheduled time, making it the most punctual airport in the World.<!--more-->
