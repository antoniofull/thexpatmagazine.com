**Sicily, South of Italy &#8211; 1973**.

This story is about a  woman and her husband. They both were **illiterate** and he was working thousands of miles away, in **Germany**. The only way to communicate to each other was asking to someone to write and then read a letter for them. But this time she decided to do it herself, and this is how she did it.

She drew this letter for him, and this is the &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">translation</span>&#8221; by the write **Comiso Geraldo** :

&#8220;_My love, the distance between us is tearing me up and I stretch my arms with our children out to you. Everybody is fine, only the youngest child is a bit sick. I didn’t receive any reply to the last letter I’ve sent you. Your mother is at the hospital where I go to visit her, don’t worry I always bring her something and I never go alone to not let people talking about me negatively, the second son comes with me and the oldest one stays at home taking care of his brother._

_I took care of seeding the fields and I paid the two men who helped me with 150.000 lire. There were the elections for the municipality and I gave my vote to “Democrazia Cristiana” as the priest suggested me. For “La Falce e il Martello” the defeat was too strong. But it doesn’t matter who wins, nobody will take care of us, the poorer ones. We hoed yesterday and we’ll do it tomorrow again._

_A lot of olive trees this year. I paid 25.000 lire for the man and the two guys who helped me. And the oil-mill costed me 12.000 lire. I got so much oil that I could fill a big jar plus a smaller one. I could earn 1.300 lire per liter. My love, my heart thinks about you. So much more now that Christmas is coming and I would love to be with you. A hug from our children and me._

_Goodbye my love, I’m only yours and faithful, holding together like our two wedding-rings._&#8221;

This really makes me think how language barriers can be shut down when your love and will are so strong, It doesn&#8217;t matter what language you speak,  you will always find a way to express your feelings and emotions. And you, what do you think?
