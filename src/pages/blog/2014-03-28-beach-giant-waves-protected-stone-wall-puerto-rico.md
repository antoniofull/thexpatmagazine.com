  This looks like a normal beach, but behind that huge stones there is the ocean
  and his huge waves. Luckily the people are protected by this stone wall and

This looks like a normal beach, but behind that huge stones there is the ocean and his huge waves. Luckily the people are protected by this stone wall and can enjoy this small part of beach relaxed with no risk.

This beach is located in **Puerto Rico** and the name is **Playa Puerto Nuevo,** the wall with these huge limestone rocks protects the beach from the waves and creates a natural swimming pool, but when the ocean waves are high then you can assist at sights like this one in the video :
