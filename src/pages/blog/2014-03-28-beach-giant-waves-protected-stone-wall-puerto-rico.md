This looks like a normal beach, but behind that huge stones there is the ocean and his huge waves. <span >Luckily the people are protected by this stone wall and can enjoy this small part of beach relaxed with no risk.<!--more-->

This beach is located in **Puerto Rico** and the name is **Playa Puerto Nuevo,** the wall with these huge limestone rocks protects the beach from the waves and creates a natural swimming pool, but when the ocean waves are high then you can assist at sights like this one in the video :
