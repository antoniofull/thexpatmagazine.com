In my early expat days, I have asked this question from myself almost once a day: Where is home?

When conversing with my colleagues and local friends, I used to refer to my rental place as home: I am going home after work to pick up my gym clothes and then we meet for the class; and: I am going to my country for a visit as a surprise for my Mother’s birthday. During calls with my family, I used to say: I am coming home for a visit before Christmas.

## So, which is a visit and which is home?

Confusing, isn\`t it? Let me roll out some of the questions, I have in mind, around this topic. Feel free to stop after the questions and write your own answers. It is a worthy exercise. Why do we say that we move to somewhere when we keep referring to our initial place as home? Shouldn\`t it be home where we have moved to?

And if not than why do we say that we are [moving to somewhere](https://www.thexpatmagazine.com/blog/2018-08-15-your-guide-to-moving-internationally/)? If it is temporarily, why don’t we mention a long trip or a lengthy stay over? Is it easier to mentally digest the move when we still get to keep home as a fix and solid reference? Do we need the stability of at least one certain place where we can always return to? Is home a place or a mental retreat?

Yeah, I know. Heavy topic. That’s is why I left you alone for some moments, to digest the questions and mainly to lead you to contemplate on your mental model of home.

I have made my first move 8200km away from my birthplace and was planning on a year and a half stay to complete my university` practical training. Then one opportunity stretched into another. One short living-abroad-experience turned into eleven countries lining up (doing 12th just now, more on my page [www.thefootloosecoach.com](http://www.thefootloosecoach.com/)).

Home was my city where I was raised by my amazing parents – they say that home is where your roots are. Then home started to become the actual place where I was staying at – as another saying goes home is where you are. Some years later, as my subconscious and the number of loved ones and places left behind significantly grew, I started to believe in the motto home is where your heart is.

We all evolve through turbulent stages and so our mental and emotional model on [what home means to us as an expat](https://www.thexpatmagazine.com/blog/2020-05-15-a-home-away-from-home/), radically changes. (you find many supporting articles here on The Expat Magazine`s website)

If you ask me today: Where is your home? I feel sure of the answer.

I have many homes and I have none. I can return to more locations which feels like home yet I don’t have to keep confined to just one spot. And now that home doesn`t need to be one physical place, I can instantly be safe, nurtured, settled and feel comfortable anywhere.

Home! I carry you and you carry me around.
