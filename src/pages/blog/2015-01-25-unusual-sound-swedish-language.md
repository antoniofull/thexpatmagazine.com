**Swedish** is a **North Germanic** language, spoken by about 10 million of people in the world. (Mostly obviously living in **Sweden** :D) Indeed not one of the most popular languages in the world.<!--more-->

Well, you might think that Swedish is an hard language(and you are probably right) and I am pretty sure, unless you are going to live there, you are not planning to learn it, but this language has a weird and unusual sound that is very fun and easy to learn, everyone should learn this.

It&#8217;s the way how the say yes and well .. we cannot write it down here, you can only listen to it and try to repeat it. I am sure you will like it .. so, check it out!
