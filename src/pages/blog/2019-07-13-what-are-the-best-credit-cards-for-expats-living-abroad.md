[Moving to a new country](https://www.thexpatmagazine.com/blog/2019-02-26-8-apps-to-make-moving-abroad-easier-infographic/) can feel like hitting reset on your whole life - especially when it comes to your finances. When I moved from Poland to London, I learnt a lot about making a home away from home. The experience is exhilarating and inspiring. But sorting out your finances is one of the more pragmatic aspects of the journey. The credit score you attentively built in your home country has to be left behind. Fortunately, there are a few options to get you back on track. 

Opening a current account is one of the first steps to becoming a resident. You can start paying bills and get a proof of address. Here are some choices to help facilitate your new life abroad.

## Monese

**I’ve picked up a few tips and tricks to getting settled as an expat. Of course, it’s important to get your finances in order. But it takes more than the usual to-do list to start feeling at home.**

## Be patient

It can take a while to truly feel at home. Just because you don’t feel instantly connected to somewhere, it doesn’t mean moving there was a mistake. You need to embrace the awkward initial period of getting used to it all, because it’s inevitable. It takes some time to acclimatise. Even if you’re moved abroad before, each country or city comes with a new set of challenges. 

## Have an open mind

You no doubt had certain expectations about moving to this new country. But be careful about being disappointed when things aren’t exactly as you imagined. Nowhere is perfect. But, most importantly, that doesn’t mean it isn’t the right place for you. Sometimes these quirks become why you love it there so much. 

## Explore

Get out and explore outside your comfort zone. There is a certain charm to walking around a new city by yourself and taking everything in. Go and find your favourite coffee shop or local park, and you’ll be feeling at home in no time. 

## Make local friends

Feeling lonely at one point or another is a natural part of moving somewhere by yourself. Sometimes you can feel like an outsider surrounded by a new place and culture. This too will pass. By making a conscious effort to meet as many new people as possible, you’ll find friends in no time. Reaching out to locals speeds up the settling in process and helps you embrace the culture. Let them teach you that native slang word or show you the best place for brunch.
