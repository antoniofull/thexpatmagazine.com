The world is becoming smaller. Thanks to advancements in communication technology, it’s become easier than ever to connect with people around the globe. This means international travel and commerce are much more common today. Thus, an unprecedented number of people are living somewhere other than their country of origin. According to a recent United Nations study, **more than 200 million people have relocated to another homeland**. If you’re about to become one of them, you have a lot of work ahead of you.

Relocating internationally is much more complicated than moving to a nearby town. You need to find professionals with specialized experience to help you. Doing so means you can avoid red tape and simple mistakes that could result in your possessions being delayed. For example, packing garden tools without cleaning them first can cause major problems. That’s because many countries have strict guidelines for protecting their local biodiversity. Even a small amount of dirt on a garden tool can be enough reason to quarantine your shipment.

Choosing the right company for your international move is one of the most important steps you can take. Make sure you receive multiple quotes and review them carefully for any additional charges you may not be expecting. If you’re planning to bring your car or another vehicle, it’s a good idea to ask your moving company about its experience shipping vehicles overseas.

For further information, **the accompanying guide contains numerous tips** to help ensure your transition is as easy as possible.
