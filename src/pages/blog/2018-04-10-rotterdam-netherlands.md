There are places that I have never thought of visiting, even less to be able to call it home; this is until I found my paradise, which is called **Rotterdam**.

How did I end up here?! Easy answer: love for myself and for a man. Yes, because my will to escape the beautiful but &#8220;small&#8221; Sicily was perfectly aligned with that feeling and the attempt to build something new for me and for the relationship back then&#8230;so I packed my luggage, umbrella, dictionary and I moved to the Netherlands.

No, it&#8217;s not all easy there, you have to deal with the language and its strange sounds, the tough weather and the food (as an Italian, good food is a very important matter!), but once you overcome the first obstacles, and having a good basic English skills, and warm clothes, you will find yourself biking while holding your umbrella, like you&#8217;ve always been in this place! This is because in Rotterdam (alright, it happens everywhere in the Netherlands), the easiest way to move around is by &#8220;fiets&#8221; (meaning bike in Dutch).

     There are so many things to see in the city, from the most famous ones such as the <strong>Cubic Houses</strong> and the <strong>Markhtal,</strong> to the beautiful <strong>Erasmus Bridge</strong>, passing from the <strong>Oude Haven</strong> (Old Harbour) and the city centre the <strong>Beurs</strong>. What made this city the paradise to me is the combination of cultures, architecture, parks in the city centre, zoo, museums and history.

    Rotterdam has a lot of history and it&#8217;s all there, you can see it just by wandering through the city, the old that survived to the II World War, and new&#8230;they both live together in an apparently disorder and extraordinary armony!

What stroke me the most? It&#8217;s what Rotterdam can offer, thanks to its soul of a metropolitan city enclosed in 319km². Further more, all the people living there, the feeling of being part of a new family met by chance during an Expat Event or while looking for a new apartment through Facebook pages and social networks. Everybody who wants to share his experience or provide useful advice to the &#8220;Expat wanna be&#8221; very often use the social networks, such as &#8220;Expats in Rotterdam&#8221;, &#8220;Italians (or French, Germans, etc.) in Rotterdam&#8221;&#8230;you might want to give it a try.

Looking for a job in 2013 was a bit easier than nowadays, anyway my advice is to learn at least English before going into this adventure. Once you&#8217;ve done that, you can download the [Undutchables] app to be up to date on new job opportunities, which you can filter by city or primary language&#8230;remember to be patient and you need a lot of enthusiasm to be back into the game. From my personal experience, I have worked in IT with 2 different companies and I have learned a lot.

From the administrational side, I remember how efficient and fast is the bureaucracy for things such as registration at the municipality, open a bank account and receiving the health insurance card. I think I did everything in 3 hours and 1 appointment, as I knew in advance all the documents needed thanks to the call I had before going to the office.

I&#8217;ll tell you more (and hopefully soon) why I moved back to Italy, how much I miss Rotterdam and my project to be back there.

Doe doe (ciao ciao)
