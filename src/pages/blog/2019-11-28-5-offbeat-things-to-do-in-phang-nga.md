Phang Nga Island is a coastal town located in the southern part of Thailand. Few people set off to visit this island, but many get stuck here on their island-hopping escapades. This is because the island has many things to do and see, and these attractions are often overlooked by people visiting Thailand. So, why exactly should you plan to visit Phang Nga?

## 1. Enjoy the great views of the James Bond Island

James Bond Island got this informal name from its appearance on the [James Bond movie, ‘The Man with the Golden Gun.’ ](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071807/)Its official name is Koh Tapu. This island offers one of the most magnificent views in the world. The best view you will get is from Phang Island. In fact, the island is so iconic that it is used in travel promotions for Thai agencies. The waters around this island are light green, and that can give you a certain sense of satisfaction and calmness. To enjoy these amazing views, you should take a boat tour from the northern end of Phucket.

## 2. Attend the Chao Ley Boat Floating Festival

Phang Nga has many annual events and festivals, and one of the most famous is the Chao Ley Boat Floating Festival. The event is meant to celebrate the spirits of the ancestors, and it features activities like ancestor veneration, fortune telling, dancing, and music performances. The floating ‘Kabang’ (small boats) are at the centre of this event, and they are believed to get rid of all misfortune. The ceremony has a similar feel to the famous Thai festival of Loi Krathong.

## 3. Shopping

A visit to Thailand has to include shopping, and there is no better place to shop than Phang Nga. The island has many tailor shops where you can purchase shirts, jackets, and other pieces of clothing. The stalls on the island offer custom-made items at moderate prices. You can purchase souvenirs from this place to take home after your visit. Some excellent shops to check out on the island include Deal, Ohm Shop, Check One Tailor, Khno Lak, and Dodee Koh Yao Noi. The shopping centres are also great places for people who want to experience Thai culture.

## 4. Phang Nga National Park

Phang Nga National Park is best known for its amazing limestone rock formations, some of which seem to defy the laws of gravity. With Phang Nga National Park tours, you will be able to visit the famous Leaning Rock, Ko Panyi, and Ko Ma Paay. At Ko Panyi, there are villages built on stilts, but since there are many people from outside the country, the authenticity of the experience will be diluted. For a better experience, you should consider working with tours which give you the chance of staying overnight.

## 5. Attend the Songkran Festival

The Thai New Year holiday is referred to as the Songkran festival. The new year is on 13th April of every year, but the celebrations run till the 15th of April. Since this is a national holiday in Thailand, you can expect a lot of cheer and festivity. Water is a major part of this festival- if you are outside on any day between the 13th and 16th of April, you can expect to be splashed with water. Buddha images are also splashed with water as a sign of respect.

## Koh Yao Noi Accommodation Options

When visiting Phang Nga, you can consider staying at Koh Yao Noi. This place is a favourite for families and has a wide range of accommodation options. You should be able to locate affordable night bamboo shacks, moderately-priced huts, and expensive pool villas. Most of the accommodations on the island are small-scale and family-run, and this comes with the advantage of a warm and helpful attitude or you can [stay at Koh Yao Noi hotels if it’s more convenient](https://coastalescape.com/blog/koh-yao-noi-accommodation-holiday-resort-hotels-villa/) for you.
