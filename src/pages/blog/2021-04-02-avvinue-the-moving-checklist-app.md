[Avvinue](https://www.avvinue.com) is a revolutionary App launched in March 2021 with the goal of helping people plan, coordinate and manage all the aspects of a moving; whatever it’s around the corner or on the other side of the world. It’s quite handy when it comes to [expat movings](https://www.thexpatmagazine.com/blog/2018-08-15-your-guide-to-moving-internationally/)!

Nicole Caba, Founder & CEO of Avvinue, says “*I’ve moved more than 12 times in the past 10 years, and every single move has been stressful and taken countless hours to coordinate. The relocation industry is fragmented and is desperate for innovation.*”

More than 156 million people move each year, and within the past year, more than 18 countries launched digital nomad visa options to cater to the remote working micro-trend in the relocation industry. On top of this, many and also big companies have announced their plan to let all the employees work from home forever. So, you can imagine how many people are already planning to move somewhere else; maybe to cheaper areas, closer to family and friends, or to their dream destination.
