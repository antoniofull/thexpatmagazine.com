\#How to choose the right health insurance for expats 
When first moving abroad, choosing the right [health insurance](https://expatfinancial.com/international-health-insurance/) is fundamental for any expat. 
Health insurance is important in some country also as a proof for getting an initial residence permit, for other is mandatory as soon as you legally register there.

So how do you choose the right health insurance? There is no perfect answer, because it really depends on a lot of subjective matters as your general health conditions, the country of origin and so on, the lifestyle etc. etc. But in general we can follow some simple rule in order to be able to find a good health insurance for our new expat life.

## 1. Verify The Country Health System

The first thing you want to do is to find out what type of health system has the country you are going to live. As said some countries have free healthcare and some others have private healthcare systems. Understanding how the system works is extremely important and there is no better place than the official websites to learn from it. Free healthcare in some countries can means long waits and also more expensive costs for private services, but also cheaper costs for private health insurances and more tailored for expats.

## 2. Single Or In Family

A lot of health insurance companies have family offers. If you have a family or partner is a good idea to look for something that covers all together. 

## 3. Make Safe Bets

While navigating the world of health insurance might be frustrating, there are some companies like [Cigna International](https://expatfinancial.com/cigna-international-health-insurance-plan/) and [Allianz](https://expatfinancial.com/allianz-international-health-insurance/) for example who are used and trusted worldwide by many expats, and have tailored offers for expats, which might ease the search. 

## 4. Global coverage is important

If we travel or we use to go back home and we are not covered home anymore, is a good idea to consider also the possibility to be covered while abroad and what exactly it is covered. You European insurance might not cover everything you need in the United States and might not work anyway in some countries. 

Always look at the coverage that you have while abroad and consider the time you will spend outside of the country.

## 5. Consider The Deductible

Before the health insurance starts paying there is usually a deductible that will have to come out of your wallet. Depending on your lifestyle and health conditions (or of the family that live with you) you might choose to pay less monthly but with a high deductible. Considering this part is extremely important as for many insurances you might not be able to change it during the year. 

A sporty person who likes practicing extreme sports, for example, might be more at risk of injury of someone who smokes regulary (in the short term), so consider your life style when making this decision.

## 6. Add Extras If You Can

How about the dentist? is at least a 6 month visit allowed? How about mental health and therapy? Many expats experience culture shock when moving. What about, again, a sport injurty and the need for some physiotherapy? You might have kids who practice some sports, health is important so consider spending some small extras, also considering the many different and unknown factor that will come with the new moving.

For example: in my first year in the Netherlands, I experienced a shift in the weather who brought me more often to the doctor than I thought, so spending more money which were not, initially covered by the insurance.

## 7. Final Tips

If you can get a face to face or voice to voice talk is better, especially for asking questions and understanding all those complex terms used in their contracts. 
Make a list of all the questions that you want to ask and try to take note.

As said above, understanding the terminology used in the health insurances might be hard.
