  It’s no secret that the process of moving abroad can be tough as it’s easy to become overwhelmed by all the things you have to do in order to get settled. Fortunately, today’s expats have the technology to support them with hundreds of apps specifically designed to help travelers and emigrants. But which ones are the best? This list from <a href="https://www.hansen-company.com/">Hansen & Company</a> lays out a handy list of eight indispensable apps which you can use to develop language skills, navigate your way around, stay safe and make friends.
</p>

## **Learning the Language** 

<p>
  <i>Duolingo</i> is a quick and easy way to squeeze in language practice. In fact, just 34 hours’ worth of its bite-sized lessons are equivalent to one semester of university-level education. For more advanced speakers, we recommend <i>Tandem</i> – a language app that pairs you up with a native speaker so you can practice your conversation skills.
</p>

## **Getting Around**

<p>
  There are plenty of options if you would like to supplement <i>Google Maps</i> with something more specialized. Those who use public transport regularly may want to download <i>Moovit,</i> whereas drivers may find <i>Waze</i> useful. Just be sure before downloading that the app will work in your new home.
</p>

## **Meeting New People**

<p>
  Making friends in a new country can be difficult, however, apps offer a stress-free way to find people in your area with similar interests. Some of our favorites include <i>MeetUp</i> and <i>CitySocialiser.</i>
</p>

## **Staying Safe**

<p>
  In unfamiliar territory, it’s important to take some precautions to keep yourself safe. <i>TripWhistle SOS</i> is a great tool for travelers as it allows you to easily and quickly access emergency numbers for the majority of countries across the world. In terms of protecting your valuables, you can’t do better than <i>Prey Anti-Theft</i> which is specifically designed to guard your electronic devices against theft.
