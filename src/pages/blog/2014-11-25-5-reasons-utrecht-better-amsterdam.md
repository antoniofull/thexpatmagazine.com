When I talk to some people and I mention that I live in The Netherlands, first question is: in Amsterdam? Some people identify the whole country with just one city, which is not fair. The Netherlands has quite some lovely city and I chose Utrecht. A very personal feeling, but I consider it the most beautiful one. Now, you're probably wondering why Utrecht is better than Amsterdam? Here following are my 5 main reasons. 

And yes, I'm very curious to hear also what are your reasons why you think the place you live in now is better than everything else. 

## 1. The canals

The _**canals of Utrecht**_ [ ](https://oranjeflamingo.wordpress.com/2014/04/11/europes-most-beautiful-canals-are-in-utrecht/)are gorgeous. Canals are very popular in The Netherlands in general and you can find them in Amsterdam too. What you won't find for sure are the restaurants along the main canal...what makes it different? Utrecht is the only city in the whole country where restaurants have terraces just next to the water, basically same level as water. The atmosphere is simply lovely.

## 2. Utrecht is still more Dutch

There are a lot of tourists and expats in both cities, but Amsterdam is kind of overcrowded. The government is trying to inspire people to visit other cities too and spread around the country the amount of tourists. I work in Amsterdam and I notice everyday is that feeling of expats taking over. When entering a bar or restaurant, the first language (even from the waiter) is English. Which makes things much easier for everyone, that's for sure. I'm not talking for everybody, but sometimes I have the feeling that people there live more in a bubble. A much different feeling here in Utrecht and I'm not talking about the language. 

## 3. Bars, Terraces, CafÃ¨s

Ok, this one is very personal, but sitting in one of the cafes in Neude (the main square) is one of my favourite thing. Yes, all of these. Sitting on a terrace in a _**Bar in Neude**_ is one of my favorite things to do. It resemble the classic European cafe' culture with car free centre and a lot of terraces and good drinks. (Tip : TryÂ **_warme wijn_** in winter :D)

## 4 Speaking about the centre, isÂ beautiful.

_**Leidseplein, Dam Square**_? They are big and full of tourists, in the evening most of them are drunk or stoned. The city often looks dirty. The centre of Utrecht is beautiful, historical, and easy to do it by walk. There are plenty of small bars where you can enjoy the real dutch atmosphere, sit down with your friends and have a beer. The city is also full of students and so parties are common in many places. Several bars organise expat events and many dutch people enjoy hanging out with expats.

## 5 Hoog Caterijne and the station.

**A station? How can a station can make Utrecht better than Amsterdam?** Well... **Hoog Caterijne** is a huge indoor shopping mall right in the hearth of the station. All the trains "stop" in **Utrecht**. Is very easy to move by public transport fromÂ **Utrecht** everywhere in **Netherlands**. If you are wondering how far is **Amsterdam from Utrecht, it is about 25 minutes by train**, several people do this every day to go to work, I do the same. Often the companies here pay the transports costs, if living a certain distance from work, so it won't cost you money. And when it's very cold you can stay in the station and shopping! Â ðŸ˜€

So, what about you? Have you ever been to _**Utrecht**_? What do you think? ðŸ˜€
