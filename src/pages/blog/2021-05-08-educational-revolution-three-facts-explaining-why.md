[Living through a pandemic](https://www.thexpatmagazine.com/blog/2020-06-05-what-expats-can-learn-from-each-other-during-quarantine) was a situation that set off alarms for all industries. These unexpected circumstances not only brought adverse effects, such as deaths and economic crises; we also saw how we could all adapt to the situation and create alternatives to return (in any way) to normality. The education industry remained prepared during 2020, seeking platforms to offer to learn and take care of teachers and students' health at the same time.

The chaos of Covid-19 is an exciting opportunity to understand how [education](https://www.thexpatmagazine.com/blog/2021-04-17-post-study-work-visa-a-complete-guide) will work in the future. Although the pandemic continues to be a problem for many countries, we can take this example to analyze the actions to take in new threats. We understood several things during the coronavirus, especially to recognize that technology is an ideal tool to overcome obstacles. What does technology offer for the education industry? Now you will see three exciting facts that will reveal the real educational revolution in the world.

1. ## Perfect Remote Education

Yes, perhaps the word "perfect" is not appropriate since this work method was in trial period during Covid-19. Many teachers, students, and representatives are against remote learning since they claim that it is not a 100 percent useful learning mechanism. Therefore, it cannot be the ideal substitute for face-to-face education. But this is the key to success! We must take users' opinions and create alternatives to make the process better and better: to achieve excellent remote education.

This type of learning not only saves on building large schools, but it can also reach inhospitable places where education is scarce. An article in The Journal claims that [remote education will continue to grow ](https://thejournal.com/articles/2020/10/29/remote-learning-will-continue-growing-over-the-next-three-years.aspx)for the next three years, reaching millions of students of all ages, especially for K-12. This study is proof that the world has a clear direction.

2. ## More Courses, Fewer Universities?

You may not have realized it, but at the moment, many companies in the United States and Europe are hiring workers from intensive courses. Is this a fantasy? Are the courses going to surpass the universities? Not for now. Current history shows us a positive context for online and face-to-face courses, especially bootcamps. These i[ntensive courses](https://bootcamprankings.com/listings/app-academy) offer degrees in tech areas such as coding, data science, cybersecurity, web design, and development software. Graduates have the opportunity to work in companies such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, or Apple.

This is not the end of universities, as these institutions are still the main target of new students and companies still want to hire their graduates. However, we must look at the growth of bootcamps in recent years. A study by Career Karma reported that the market for [coding bootcamps ](https://bootcamprankings.com/university-coding-bootcamps)increased 4.38 percent in 2019. Can you imagine landing your dream job after finishing a course in a few months? Welcome to the education revolution!

3. ## More Efficient Learning Techniques

Bringing education to more people is an optimistic goal, but what should we do to make that education much more efficient? Teaching is not enough when students do not retain information and do not know how to use knowledge to solve problems. For that reason, the tech industry has invested millions of dollars in promoting more efficient learning techniques. These methods are innovative, and they are already among us. Look at the following points.

### Artificial Intelligence

School and study platforms are using this software to convert individual student skills into practical knowledge. With AI, questions, and answers on tests and assignments have more objective results than ever before.

### Virtual Reality

Several companies are manufacturing virtual reality glasses and systems for students of all ages. This technology allows users to have a more accurate reference to the real elements or circumstances without having to be there. A FrontCore study said that virtual reality allows for [75 percent retention of learning](https://frontcore.com/blog/is-vr-training-more-efficient-than-other-learning-methods/).

### E-learning

With this system, students have access to a lot of information to reinforce their learning in school. E-learning not only covers virtual classes but study tools for exams, homework, talks, and much more.

## Conclusion:

Perhaps Covid-19 was just a small opportunity to see how health, family, and education are essential things in the world. This article allows us to observe the collaboration of the tech industry with learning. The more people have broad knowledge, the easier it will be to find solutions to future problems.
