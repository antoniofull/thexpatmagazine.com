### 1 Iceland.

This small country is the most **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">peaceful country in the world** according with the **GPI**. Criminality practically does not exist and their army which is basically a Coast Guard and is the only NATO member to have Â a "standing army".

### 2 Denmark

Again a nordic country at the top of the list. This time is Denmark which is more populated than Iceland and, obviously hosts a bigger expats community. Anyway this country is also one of the happiest country in the world, so it seems to be very pleasant to **live in Denmark**. ðŸ™‚

### 3 New Zealand

New Zealand is not only a peaceful country, ranking third in this list, but is also a country with a vibrant economy and in a strong demand of expats. Beside that is beautiful and is more easy to get a VISA than Australia. Â If you can get used to earthquake then might be a good choice.

### 4 Austria

**Austria** is, together with **Switzerland**, one of the country with the highest living standard in the world. It ranks 4th in this list but the capital, **Vienna**, ranks first as the best city in the world for quality living.

### 5 Switzerland

Obviously also Switzerland made the list. Â It is probably more expensive than Austria but Zurich usually is ranked as one of the best and most expensive city in the world. The salary are also high ðŸ˜‰

### 6 Japan

The country of manga and new technologies ranks as the first most peaceful asian country, even if this rank could be debated with Singapore.

### 7 Finland

Again Europe, again North. Finland is the 7th most peaceful country in the world. Probably not the first choice for many expats. ðŸ™‚

### 8 Canada

Canada also make the list as 8th most **peaceful country in the world**. Â Canada is also working on some plans to lure more [expats in the country].

### 9 Sweden

Sweden ranks 9th in this list. Among the nordic scandinavian countries is probably the one that is having more problem with the economic turndown that is affecting Europe.

### 10 Belgium

This little state in the centre of Europe is the 10th in the list. Is a very pacific and nice place where to live, with some of the most beautiful city in Europe like **Brugges and Gent**.
