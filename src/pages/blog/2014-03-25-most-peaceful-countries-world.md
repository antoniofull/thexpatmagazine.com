### 1 Iceland.

This small country is the most **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">peaceful country in the world** according with the **GPI**. Criminality practically does not exist and their army which is basically a Coast Guard and is the only NATO member to have Â a "standing army".

### 2 Denmark

Again a nordic country at the top of the list. This time is Denmark which is more populated than Iceland and, obviously hosts a bigger expats community. Anyway this country is also one of the happiest country in the world, so it seems to be very pleasant to **live in Denmark**. ðŸ™‚

### 3 New Zealand

New Zealand is not only a peaceful country, ranking third in this list, but is also a country with a vibrant economy and in a strong demand of expats. Beside that is beautiful and is more easy to get a VISA than Australia. Â If you can get used to earthquake then might be a good choice.
