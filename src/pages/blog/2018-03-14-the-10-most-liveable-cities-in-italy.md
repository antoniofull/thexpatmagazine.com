Italy is a beautiful country, so many cities and with so many things to visit and explore, so the perfect place for holidays, but what about the quality of life if you decide to live there? There are different key elements that have been considered, just to mention some: services, environment, public transport and population. Here for you the top 10 most liveable cities in the &#8220;Bel Paese&#8221;.

### 10. Florence, Tuscany

You are surrounded by so many historical buildings and it&#8217;s almost like going back in the history, you can learn a lot about Michelangelo, Donatello, De&#8217; Medici family and all the other most famous artists who lived there. It&#8217;s a live city, a lot of restaurants and café, as well as many tourists all year around, which makes the living in this city very challenging. Also, you have to consider that the centre is restricted to traffic, and it&#8217;s not very easy to find a job unless you have experience in the hospitality.

### 9. Rome, Lazio

La Dolce Vita is the first thing you though about as soon as you read Rome, isn&#8217;t that right? No wonder how the Eternal city caught the heart of millions of people around the world. Its beauty and its history leave you breathless, so I strongly suggest to add this city to your &#8220;top cities to visit before you die&#8221;. On the other side, if you&#8217;re thinking of actually moving there, you may want to consider a couple of things more. The local transport and the traffic jam are the city&#8217;s pain points, it takes really long to travel from one side to the other, regardless of the way you choose to move around.

### 8. Reggio Emilia, Emilia Romagna

Considering that Reggio Emilia is not a metropolitan city nor one of the biggest in Italy, its undoubted historical and architectural beauties still put this city into this top list. No need to mention the delicious local cuisine that you can taste in any of the many restaurants in the centre, the fact that it&#8217;s hometown to the Italian flag, its lovely historical centre and a good service level overall.

### 7. Brescia, Lombardy

Great location and well connected with many cities in the Northern of the country, Brescia offers a good live balance, including quite some activities to keep you busy during weeks and weekends. In 2017 Brescia and its province were the European Region of Gastronomy, and this helped the city to climb up the list.

### 6. Trento, Trentino Alto Adige

You didn&#8217;t expect to see this city in the list, did you? Surprisingly, it has a lot to offer and its university is considered the second best one in Italy for off-students. It&#8217;s the perfect place for mountain and outdoor activity lovers, as you have it all: Dolomites and lakes, as well as art and traditions.

### 5. Parma, Emilia Romagna

Here&#8217;s another city of Emilia Romagna, the lovely Parma famous not just for its ham and Parmigiano cheese, but for its beauty as well. It&#8217;s a small and quiet city, safe and clean, with many parks and green areas.

### 4. Mantova, Lombardy

The fourth place goes to Mantova, Italian Capital of Culture in 2016, an event that put the city in the spotlight and attracted much more tourists. Its beautiful historical centre, good services and facilities, and its culture give room to a very well balanced quality life.

### 3. Turin, Piedmont

&nbsp;

This dynamic, cultural and mysterious city, definitely efficient in services, is hometown to the renowned University. There are various historical places and monuments, as well as chocolate shops where you can enjoy pleasant moments of sweetness with partners and friends. Quality of life in Turin is quite high.

&nbsp;

### 2. Milan, Lombardy

Excellent results for the well known busy city. As everyone knows (and it is not just a stereotype) life here flows frenetic, often too much, but Milan really offers a lot: services, entertainment of all kinds, both luxury shops and affordable for everyone, concerts, exhibitions, events, art, libraries, parks and culture. If you&#8217;re looking for a job, this is definitely the city that can offer you more and more opportunities. A rich city, where it is easy to get used to live, but which requires knowing how to adapt to its rhythms.

### 1. Bologna, Emilia Romagna

And the winner is: Bologna! Standing out for its management capacity, for the usability of its services and for its digital infrastructures. Apparently Bologna is the top city to really live well. It is also an excellent university city and not by chance first even in the ranking regarding the best Italian university cities. Live city and rich in culture, offers leisure for all tastes. Its center is alive, stimulating and full of activities.
