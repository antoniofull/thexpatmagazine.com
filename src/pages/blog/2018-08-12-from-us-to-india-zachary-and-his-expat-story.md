More and more people move abroad looking for new opportunities, they choose the place based on what they like the most, as well as where love or a job¬†will bring them. ¬†I&#8217;m always amazed by all the stories I hear and come across with. That&#8217;s why today I want to share with all of you Zachary&#8217;s expat life, who moved from US¬†to India. ¬†Here&#8217;s his story.

&#8220;_As I approach 7 years of living in India, I‚Äôve been reflecting on my journey and what it‚Äôs entailed. Starting in Mumbai and ending in Kolkata, it‚Äôs been a **rollercoaster of extraordinary experiences**, discovery, frustration, transformation, self-discovery, great sorrow, great joy and a deep love for the country my family calls home._

_India holds a dear place to me and my wife Amanda; after all we met in India, dated in India, got engaged in front of the Taj Mahal, hosted a wedding reception for our family and friends in India, buried our daughter Chloe West Ray after a stillbirth at 27 weeks, and had our son, Kaden, in India._

_As you know, Kolkata is known for its¬†chai, and chai is one of the ways in which people bond. You can spot teashops at every corner of the city. And¬†chai, I noticed, lives up to its reputation of bringing people together._

_As a company and as an artist, that is what we wish to accomplish ‚Äì- bringing people together and building a community. The arts are able to connect people from anywhere on the globe in a way that little else can, and we‚Äôd love to be a part of building a community that uses the arts to inspire and make the world a better place. It is this thought that inspired us to name our venture Chaitown Creatives._

_We started Chaitown Creatives two years ago with the goal to provide a platform for musicians and artists (like painters, photographers and designers, etc.), to express themselves and help them further their careers. We host ‚ÄúArtist Collective‚Äù sessions every month, where one or two artists present their work in front of an audience and interact with them. You don‚Äôt have to be a musician or an artist to be part. You just need to be able to appreciate the different forms of art that exist. We‚Äôre convinced that India, especially Kolkata, has a lot to offer to the world in terms of art, music and creativity._

_India is a great place to call home. For anyone considering a move here, our advice is usually pretty simple: connect with people, be flexible, and be positive. The deep-rooted bonds that Indians share have been our biggest gift from the country. The friends we have made here have helped us out in difficult, as well as good times. They are our family. If we ever move back to the United States, I know that the friends we have made here are for life._

_Our days in India don‚Äôt look like they might if we lived in the US, and that‚Äôs okay. We‚Äôve learned the value of being both flexible and positive. Things may not always go as you are used to when you live in a foreign country, and maybe not even how you would like, but we‚Äôve found, even in those experiences, we can learn, laugh, and sometimes even make lifelong friends.&#8221;_
