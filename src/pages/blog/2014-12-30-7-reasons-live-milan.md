As soon as I say Italy there are 3 main things that pop up in your mind: _**pizza, bolognese and pasta**_. Am I right? ‚Äú_Il Bel Paese_‚Äù is well known for its food and the beauty of its cities. But would you live in one of them? What about Milan? The economic capital of Italy. Here ¬†for you _**7 reasons why you should live in Milan.**_<!--more-->

## 1 The coffee's world.

Once you start living in Milan you learn what is the difference between a caff√®, caff√® corretto, caff√® macchiato, cappuccino, latte macchiato, etc. Moreover, you learn at what time of the day each drink is appropriate, and you learn to look down at people who ask for a cappuccino after 11:00 in the morning.

### 2 BikeMi in love

If you start, you will not be able to stop. The bike will make you feel brave enough to go around in the city. All streets don't have bike paths, but you will manage to find your way.

## 3 Never miss an "aperitivo"

The word aperitivo will fill your days, whatever it is weekend or not. I don't need to add anything else, you know what I mean üôÇ

Everything you need can be found at _**Esselunga**_ supermarkets.¬† The coolest thing is that you can shopping online and a gentle man will bring you everything at home at the time you choose, but don't forget to get the fidelity card Fidaty.

## 5. The desert in August.

What do people do in _August_ in **Milan**? Basically you won't find anyone, because everybody goes on holiday. Shops, restaurants and bars you are closed, but you can still enjoy the quiet in the city centre.

## 6- Public transports and strikes.

Don't tell me you're still surprised? There is a strike once per month and -the funniest thing it happens ALWAYS on Friday. No worries, you will get used to it and, most of the time, don't get pissed off üôÇ

## 7- The Duomo.

It's the beautiful _**Gothic Cathedral of Milan**_ and the third biggest church in Europe. It will seduce you every time you pass in front of it. It doesn't matter if it's every single day, it will still be as impressive as it was the first day.
