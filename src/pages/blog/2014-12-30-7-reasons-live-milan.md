As soon as I say Italy there are 3 main things that pop up in your mind: ***pizza, bolognese and pasta***. Am I right? ‚Äú*Il Bel Paese*‚Äù is well known for its food and the beauty of its cities. But would you live in one of these cities? What about Milan? The economic capital of Italy. Do you want to discover more? Here's¬†for you ***5 things you should know about Milan.***

### 1- In love with BIkeMi

Once you start, you won't be able to stop. You can subscribe and hire these bikes from different spots in the city, as well as leaving them to dedicated spots. So very handy while moving around the city and it will make you feel brave enough to go anywhere. Bike paths are not everywhere, which can be challenging but you will manage to find your way.

## 2- Never miss an "aperitivo"

The word aperitivo will fill your days, whatever it is weekend or not. There are loads of places across the city where you can enjoy a nice drink along with good for a fixed price. Some places will give you more like bites with cold cuts, cheeses, crisps and so on; while other places will give you something that looks like more like a dinner. You'll love it! üôÇ

## 3- Esselunga's **addiction**

Everything you need can be found at ***Esselunga*** supermarkets.¬†They are everywhere and have a very wide selection of products and prices. You can't be in Milan if you don't go to Esselunga. You can also order online and have delivered at home. Don't forget to get the difelity card Fidaty to collect bonuses & points for a present receive.

## 4- The desert in August.

What do people do in *August* in **Milan**? Basically you won't find anyone, because everybody goes on holiday. Most of the shops, restaurants and bars are closed. It may seem very strange at first, but I think it's the best time to enjoy the city without walking in croweded stretts or taking packed transports. It's something quite unique!

## 5- The Duomo.

It's the beautiful ***Gothic Cathedral of Milan*** and the third biggest church in Europe. It will seduce you every time you pass in front of it. It's impressive and fascinating. You can also climb up to admire the architecture and to have a beautiful view over the city. Once on top, you'll be surprised how quiet it is over there compared to the rest of the city.
