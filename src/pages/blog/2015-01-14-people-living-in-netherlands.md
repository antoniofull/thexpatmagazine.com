**Netherlands** is a small country but there are a lot of expats living here, especially in the crowded Amsterdam.

## 1 &#8211; Bring your costume &#8230; to &#8230; the .. canal

Yes, sun is an option here, you won&#8217;t see it often. So when it happens people run to the canals or, the luckiest, next to the beach to enjoy every single second of it. If you decided to live in a city like Amsterdam, it might be common to go to the canals with some food and drinks, and friends of course, but where it gets really cool is when you rent a boat and go trough the canal with a couple of heineken box with you.

## 2 &#8211; The Agenda will save your life

Dutch use agenda, really a lot. They plan everything and so you will have to do if you want to &#8220;survive&#8221; the social life in the Netherlands. You might be invited for a birthday party even 3 months in advance, and so for Christmas. So want o not you must use an agenda.

## 3 &#8211; Birthdays are cheap!

Don&#8217;t expect to spend a lot of money for your colleague&#8217;s birthday, 1 or 2 euros are enough, but most of the times you won&#8217;t even buy a present, so don&#8217;t expect one when it&#8217;s your turn! ðŸ™‚

## 5 &#8211; You get used to a glass just rinsed in the water in a crowded bar.

Not surprising many toilet are not for free. There you will find a lady or man expecting from you to pay. Some toilets are really nice and clean, like the ones in the Park next to the Van Gogh Museum, but they will cost you even 50 cents.
