## 9 Faroes Island.

I was also surprised to see this small, remote island in the list, but after reading the reasons it seems pretty clear why. This arcipelago in the **North Atlantic** is since 5 years the home to the most secluted avant-garde food. Â Leading the way is _**Koks**_, a signatory of the <a href="https://www.clausmeyer.dk/en/the_new_nordic_cuisine_/manifesto_.html"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Nordic Kitchen Manifesto </a>, which stresses modern cuisine made from local, seasonal ingredients , and _**Aarstova**_, a French restaurant using Faroese ingredients.
