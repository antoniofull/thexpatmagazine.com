## 9 &#8211; Faroes Island.

I was also surprised to see this small, remote island in the list, but after reading the reasons it seems pretty clear why. This arcipelago in the **North Atlantic** is since 5 years the home to the most secluted avant-garde food. Â Leading the way is _**Koks**_, a signatory of the <a href="http://www.clausmeyer.dk/en/the_new_nordic_cuisine_/manifesto_.html" target="_blank"><em><strong>Nordic Kitchen Manifesto</strong></em></a>, which stresses modern cuisine made from local, seasonal ingredients , and _**Aarstova**_, a French restaurant using Faroese ingredients.

## 10 &#8211; Macedonia.

The next **Balcan destination**, according with the New York Times. First comes **Croatia**, then **Montenegro** and **Albania** and then, _**Macedonia**_. Beside being known for it _moody monasteries_ and sparkling _Lake Ohrid_, Macedonia is also making a name in the tourist industry as a **food destination**.
