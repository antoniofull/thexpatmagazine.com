Moving abroad to pursue your under graduation or masters? Well, it does sound fun but it is not as rosy a picture as it looks like. You really need to be able to handle all the aspects of living alone - from taking care of your meals to keeping your apartment clean, you need to do it all. Don't worry, we have a few tips on how you can make the most of your stint abroad without taking too much stress. Follow these 13 simple tips and you are good to go!

## 1. Organize 

While preparing for your trip abroad, ask questions to your trip advisor, teachers or former students who have studied abroad. You will get a rough idea of how things work abroad and how you can plan your budget. Do not leave the paperwork for last minute as it will create a lot of hassle. 

## 2. Pick up the local culture

Before you reach your new home, you must know facts about that place. You need to know about their culture, the kind of music which is popular, or maybe the famous places you can visit. All these will only add to your knowledge and will make you feel comfortable at your new home.

## 3. Plan your budget

Create a budget, and most importantly, stick to it. No matter how less or more the cost of living is, if you don't know where your money is going then you're in a soup. Divide your money into sections to know how much you need to pay for the rent, electricity and other expenses. This will help you keep a tab on your cash. There are various [budget management apps](https://www.mim-essay.com/best-budget-app-for-money-management/) like Mint which help you in budgeting and sticking to it. 

## 4. Adapt

During your stint abroad, live as the locals do. Take the public transport they use, eat the local food, and try to pick up their language. Not only will these help you in your survival, it will also help you in gelling with the locals, thus making your stay better. 

## 5. Don't lose your focus

Yes, your adopted country will be a lot of fun with various activities, get-togethers and parties, but that does not mean you get so involved that you lose sight of the bigger picture, which is - STUDIES. Do not forget that you have gone there to study. Do not let anything or anyone distract you from your goals.

## 6. Befriend locals

In order to make the most of your study abroad trip, do not befriend only those students who have come from different nations, like you. Make some new friends belonging to the country you are visiting. Not only will you learn a thing or two about their culture and city, you will also have somebody to fall back on in case of emergency. Remember, you are anyway away from home! Also, who does not like making new friends? 

## 7. Be open-minded

No matter how many times this advice is repeated, it will never be enough. Do not make the mistake of arriving at your adopted country with  a head brimming with stereotype. Let go of all the prejudices that you might have had for this new place and instead relax and look at things with a new perspective. Be open to new ideas, traditions and people. Try to avoid comparing them with your home country and instead be open to whatever the new place has to offer. 

## 8. Discover your cooking skills

Why not? Utilize your 'eating-out' spending plan and cook at home. Trust us, you will spare about 30% to half of your spending plan with this! If you are always tight on schedule, cook in huge bits and store it in the refrigerator; warm and have later so you don't need to cook every day. It is not only a much healthier option, but will also save money for you. 

## 9. Watch your expenses

Think of it - you are in an alien country away from your family with a limited budget. So why not put a stop on unnecessary expenditure and instead focus on keeping a budget which will last you the whole month without any problem. That obviously does not mean that one stops going out and having fun.  Do that but do keep a watch on your own self!

## 10. Learn the language

As we know the key to effective communication is understanding and talking in the same language, so why not go ahead and learn the language spoken in the country you are going. This will help you in communicating with the locals and at the same time you get to learn something new! On the brighter side, you will also get to add another language in your CV!

## 11. Consider community living

In order to save expenses, consider community living. The university hostels are sometimes full or one may not want to live within the constraints of a hostel. In that case, community living can be a feasible option. It will save money and teach you how to adjust with different kind of people. 

## 12. Get a part-time job

Try getting a part-time job in order to meet your expenses,  spend more and save more! You can always opt for getting a job of your interest and work post college hours. Though this will keep you on your toes at all times, it will only be beneficial for your pockets. Also, it always feels good to have that air of independency. 

## 13. Learn to live with home-sickness

Being away from friends and family, it is nothing but natural to feel home sick. However, don't let that get the best of you and wear you down. You must learn [how to deal with home-sickness](https://www.thexpatmagazine.com/blog/2019-04-18-feeling-at-home-in-abroadland/). Try to maintain a home away from home because who knows, maybe one day your friends in this new country become so special that you stop missing your home country altogether! 

In conclusion, do not hesitate to step out and explore, and follow these 13 tips for a comfortable living abroad!
