If you had the chance to come to The Netherlands or talk to people that live in Amsterdam and Rotterdam, you already know there is a kind of competition between this two cities. But how different are they? Which one is better?

Let's start to say that the cities are both  located in the area called Holland, of The Nerherlands, Rotterdam in the South Holland and Amsterdam in the North Holland Region.

I belive they are both beautiful even if in a different way, probably Rotterdam is more unique because of its story that made it as the center of modernism in the Country. Rotterdam, or Roffa, as Dutches call it, was bombing during the II World War and its center totally destroyed and rebuilt again in a more actual way... from there on it became the city of architecture and it is enough to have a short walk in some areas to realise it. One example for all the Cubic Houses. Instead Amsterdam keeps a more typical and traditional architecture, with the classic houses built with bricks in front of the canals.

Out of my experience Rotterdam is less chaotic and better organized, it is enough to think about traffic jam and the proper passage for the bikes. If Rotterdam leaves you speachless because of its unicity, order, weird buildings, Amsterdam achieves the same effect with its romanticism, the canals all around and autenticity.

Tallkig about expat life I would say I don't know anybody complaining about living here or there, but for sure, if you get to live in one of these two cities, you'll never move to the other.  It is possible to find expats communities. Inclusion and culture blend are granted everywhere. It might change the reason why people decide for one or the other. Rotterdam is full of students from Erasmus MC (so not only very young but variety of age and background) and TUI Delft (architecture university) , Amsterdam is certaintly more visited by turist during all year and still a bit more international. What do I mean with that? If you are looking for a job position a bit higher than commom, and you don't speak Dutch, you have more change in Amsterdam than in Rotterdam, not only because is the capital and got more multinational companies, also because English is enough also for internal communications and there are more job opportunities in Sales and Marketing. Even if you want to work in a restaurant and you don't know yet the local language you get a lot more chance to do it in the Capital as people are more used to that, as said is definitely more turistic all year long and expats came first there than in anywhere else. Rotterdam still provides some possibilities for not Dutch speakers, but there are still a lot of Companies using Dutch as internal language and this is because they are Dutch companies that are growing and started some business worldwide. It doesn't mean there are not international companies in Rotterdam, I am just considering the whole scenario. Other opportunities for non -dutch speakers are in  Start-ups and those are very easy to find in all the man cities of the Country.

Fun facts: Rotterdam is the city with the most high level of english language in The Netherlands. You probably don't expect so after reading the info just provided. Guess why?  It is because of the great amount of masters, phd etc... and the importance of its universities, at least, in Europe. Untill not too long time ago, expats in Rotterdam were almost only high level students that needed to study here to get the chance to have a good career and their level of English needed to be the top.

Fun facts 2 = In Rotterdam the Red Loght Ditrict doesn't exist.

Last differce but not least, pricing for the apartments! Recently things changed a lot and even if Amsterdam remains more expensive also Rotterdam saw a huge increase of the price both for rent both for buy.  In Amsterdam for a good apartment to rent you need around 1400/1500 € per month, in Rotterdam 1300€. AFor buying both cities are around 4000€ per square meter.

Personally I have chosen Rotterdam because I have left my heart here since the first time I came, at the same time I love to have a walk in the crazy Amsterdam sometimes.  If you are wondering to move in The Netherlands and are not sure about which city you would like to go, just come here, have a walk in both, spend a weekend in each of them and follow your heart... at the end of the day, it is all about love.
