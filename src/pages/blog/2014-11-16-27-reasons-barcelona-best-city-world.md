**Watching Barcelona at Camp Nou** is a must-do while in Barcelona

The football, well soccer, team is not just a soccer team. Is a symbol, the symbol of "catalanism" and so representing the whole region. Messi, Neymar and the other champions are the local heroes. Every one loves Barca (and hate Real Madrid ðŸ˜€).

## The Sant Antoni Market

Visit the **Sant Antoni Market on sunday morning**, is a market of vintage books, comics coins and other curious stuff. And, of course,  full of tourists.

## The Magic Fountain

The magic fountain is well .. a Magic fountain! No seriously watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DFHyxlJdn0) Â to understand what that means!

## La Xampanyeria

![Barcelona Xampanyeria](/img/uploads/2014/11/4517812079_534972d867_o-1024x683.jpg "Barcelona Xampanyeria")

## Leo Messi

![Leo Messi](/img/messi.jpg "Messi Barcelona")

The best soccer player in the world, and the King of Barcelona. Wherever you go you will see his face or his t-shirt. Seriously, he is much more important than the King of Spain here in Catalonia.

## The Weather

![Barcelona Weather](/img/uploads/2014/11/11666442975_424202c27f_b.jpg)

_**Weather in Barcelona**_ is perfect, winter are not cold or at least nothing compared with a winter in Chicago. Summer is hot with a lot of light during the day, it can be still day at **10:30**.

## MontjuÃ¯c.

![Barcelona MontjuÃ¯c](/img/montjuic.jpg "MontjuÃ¯c")

Where the 1992 Olympic game where played.Â MontjuÃ¯c is up on a mountain and so less crowded than the centre. The view is amazing, is it possible to visit the old Stadium of Espanyol, the second team of Barcelona.Â MontjuÃ¯c hosts also a lot of concert. I a bit tricky to get there but it's worth all the efforts.

Pro tip : go when the _**Magic Fountain**_ is about to start, go on top and enjoy ðŸ˜€

## La Bouqueria.

![Barcelona Bouqueria](/img/bouqueria.jpg "Bouqueria Barcelona Market")

_**La Bouqueria**_ is a large public market held in **Las Ramblas** where you can enjoy all type of foods and of course, sea food. Fish is fresh and cheap, there are also plenty of typical small groceries with candies, chocolates and other delicious food. La Bouqueria is a must-see for everyone in Barcelona.

## Placa Reial

![Barcelona Placa Reialtories](/img/uploads/2014/11/2257660666_c2fea1144e_b.jpg)

My favorite place! _**Place Reial**_ is a small, incredible vibrant square just off Las Ramblas. In a very small place there are plenty of bars and locals, live music and so much more!

_**Pro Tip**_ : Don't drink beer at the bars as they are very expensive, buy one in the street for 1 euro and sit down near the fountain. Then enjoy the atmosphere.

## TheÂ **Gothic Quarter**

![Barcelona Gothic](/img/uploads/2014/11/2190516154_a6930a0a7a_o.jpg)

**El Barri Gotic** The most vibrant, colorfoul district of Barcelona. Walking between those old buildings from the roman era, or just sitting down in one of the various tapas bar while thousands of different people walk around you. Be careful, after Las Ramblas this is the preferred spot forÂ pickpocketing, you have been warned!

## Bocadillos i queso!

![Barcelona Bocadillos](/img/uploads/2014/11/bocadillo.jpg)

When it's late morning and you are coming back after a great night of party, there is nothing better than a **bocadillo i lomo i queso**! You can find bars that sell **bocadillos** everywhere in Barcelona, as usual just look for local bars and avoid touristic places.

## Costa Brava

![Barcelona Stosta Bravaories](/img/uploads/2014/11/costa-brava.jpg)

Tired of parties and fiesta all night long? Looking for a place where chill out and recover from the hard city life? Then you should go to visit **Costa Brav**a which is about **60km** and it ends up next to the French border. **Beaches**, landscape and mountains, what do you need more? ðŸ˜€

Pro Tip : Flying from Europe the airport of **Girona** has low-cost flights from **Ryanair**.

## El Raval

![Barcelona El Raval](/img/uploads/2014/11/3373581872_a5ef0cb031_b.jpg)

The multicultural district of Barcelona, unfortunately not so safe anymore. Still nice if you want to go in the afternoon with your friends, avoid if you are alone in the night.

## Tibidabo!

![Barcelona Tibidabo](/img/uploads/2014/11/7197066400_c0b3fd124e_k.jpg)

Go high! Tibidabo is the mountain that "looks" at Barcelona. Â Is the highest point, 512 meters, and the view is absolutely amazing. You can take the funicular if you want to!
