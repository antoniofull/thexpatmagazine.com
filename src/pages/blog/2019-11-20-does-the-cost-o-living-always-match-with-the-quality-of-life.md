Let’s say that in a perfect world everybody is free to choose the best country and start a new life there. How you would choose it? What is the first information you would like to have?

I did some researches about the cost of living and quality of life, and you might be surprised by the result!

Following the data from “World data info” , Bermuda is at the top of the list for the cost of living but it gets the 27th place for quality of life.

In some cases, the less expensive countries are, actually, the best place to live, but is it all about money?! I am not sure.

Let’s have a quick look together at the first 30 Countries for the cost of living (on the left) and quality of life (on the right):

1. Bermuda	               Australia
2. Switzerland	        Macao
3. Iceland	                Hong Kong
4. Norway	                Portugal
5. Bahamas	         Malta
6. Denmark	                 Switzerland
7. Luxemburg	         Austria
8. Virgin Islands	         Singapore
9. Israel	                 Japan
10. Australia	                 Germany
11. Ireland	                 Czechia
12. Sweden	                 Spain
13. Finland	                 Netherlands
14. New Zealand          Cyprus
15. United States	         South Korea
16. United Kingdom	 Croatia
17. Japan	                 Norway
18. Netherlands	         Canada
19. Belgium	                 Luxembourg
20. France	                 United Arab Emirates
21. Austria	                 Denmark
22. Canada	                 Sweden
23. Singapore	         Finland
24. Hong Kong	         New Zealand
25. South Korea	         Poland
26. Germany	          Slovenia
27. Italy	                         Bermuda
28. Qatar	                 Greece
29. Macao	                 Bulgaria
30. Malta	                 Italy

Those lists take into account, especially, the monthly income (that has not to be confused with a wage or salary) and it is calculated from the gross national income per capita, the stability, civil rights, health and medical services, security, climate, costs and popularity.

I’d add to the list the word _opportunities,_ I believe that, one of the reasons that make us feel good as expats in a new country is the possibility to choose, have alternatives and be valued for our job. What do you think? What did you take into account choosing your new country/city and why?

You can have a better view of the data per [quality of life](https://www.worlddata.info/quality-of-life.php) and [cost of living](https://www.worlddata.info/cost-of-living.php).
