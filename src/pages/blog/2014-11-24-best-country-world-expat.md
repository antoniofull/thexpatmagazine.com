## Ease of Settling In Index

Ecuador ranks 8th in this special Index. 82% of expats living in Ecuador feels like at home and found very easy to settle down. Many have mentioned the ease of make friends as one of the most important factor that helped them to settle down.

## Personal Happiness

Here Ecuador is the first. More than 85% of the participants feels happy _living in Ecuador_ and half of them says he is **&#8220;Very Happy&#8221;**.

## Satisfied with their life

Over **90% of expats** are absolutely satisfied of their move to Ecuador. The **42%** is so happy that is planning to live in **Ecuador possibly for ever**.

As we can see the main reasons is basically the life style, over 39% of expats here are retired people and **Ecuador** is not a country where finding a good job is an easy task, but despite that expats love the country and feels that they improved their lifestyle.

There is also a very small downside. The language is not easy to learn for many expats and english is not entirely spoken. But as people are so friendly this is the last of the problem for the expats.
