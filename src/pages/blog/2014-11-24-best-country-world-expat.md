## Satisfied with their life

Over **90% of expats** are absolutely satisfied of their move to Ecuador. The **42%** is so happy that is planning to live in **Ecuador possibly for ever**.

As we can see the main reasons is basically the life style, over 39% of expats here are retired people and **Ecuador** is not a country where finding a good job is an easy task, but despite that expats love the country and feels that they improved their lifestyle.

There is also a very small downside. The language is not easy to learn for many expats and english is not entirely spoken. But as people are so friendly this is the last of the problem for the expats.
