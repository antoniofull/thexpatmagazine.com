[**Switzerland** approved with a referendum](https://amzn.to/3ovXp17) a new law to **limitate immigration in the country.** After a very uncertain exit poll the yes won for **50.3%**.

The referendum was promoted by right wing party **UDC/SVP** which is not only against immigrations but also against **EU**. In this way the little country can put a limit to the Citizens entering the country and gets more control on the borderline workers, thus people working in **Switzerland** but living in other countries, Italy and France mostly. Those Â people were the first target of the referendum since are accused of taking money and bring them out of the country.

It will be hard now to get a **Job in Switzerland.**
