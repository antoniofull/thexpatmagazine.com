**Switzerland** approved with a referendum a new law to limitate immigration in the country. After a very uncertain exit poll the yes won for **50.3%**.

The **European Union** did not like the move of **Switzerland**, which goes against the agreements taken previously with EU. The first result is that Swiss students will not be accepted anymore to Erasmus program.<!--more-->

The referendum was promoted by right wing party **UDC/SVP** which is not only against immigrations but also against **EU**. In this way the little country can put a limit to the Citizens entering the country and gets more control on the borderline workers, thus people working in **Switzerland** but living in other countries, Italy and France mostly. Those Â people were the first target of the referendum since are accused of taking money and bring them out of the country.

It will be hard now to get a **Job in Switzerland.**
