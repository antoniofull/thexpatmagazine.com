### 4. Ireland

Surrounded by the ocean, Irland will surprise you with its pictoresque villages and beautiful natural sites.

### 8. Netherlands

Maybe it's for the canals, its typical houses or the colourful tulips in spring, but for sure Netherlands has a lot to offer to expats, such as International communities and good working conditioning.
