### 8. Netherlands

Maybe it's for the canals, its typical houses or the colourful tulips in spring, but for sure Netherlands has a lot to offer to expats, such as International communities and good working conditioning. Also, Dutch people speak perfectly English, so it would be easier to settle down even if you don't speak the local language yet.
