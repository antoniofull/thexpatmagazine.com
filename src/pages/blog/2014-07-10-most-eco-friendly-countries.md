The university of Yale has released his annual EPI, **Environmental Performance Index, **which is basically the ranking of the countries that do the most for the environment.

As is stated in their <a href="https://epi.yale.edu"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>

> "The Environmental Performance Index (EPI) ranks how well countries perform on high-priority environmental issues in two broad policy areas: protection of human health from environmental harm and protection of ecosystems."

So, let's see who rank the **first 10**.

### **1 Iceland.**

As usual Iceland ranks the first. The small country does a lot for the environment, both with social and political initiatives.
