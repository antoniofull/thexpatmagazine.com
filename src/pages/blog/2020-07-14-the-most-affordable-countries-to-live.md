Who was thinking to [move abroad](https://www.thexpatmagazine.com/blog/2019-02-26-8-apps-to-make-moving-abroad-easier-infographic/) before the lockdown? And who is still thinking that? Of course, the situation may be changed and there might be much more things to consider, but if you want to move abroad it is still possible. 

We want to help you by sharing the [OceanFinance's research](https://www.oceanfinance.co.uk/blog/reality-of-relocating-europes-cheapest-countries-revealed/) to understand what are the most affordable countries to live and who know, you may find the place you were looking for.

Ocean Finance hs investigated 11 typical expenses by using data from Espastistan, Finder and Numbero. Among these expenses you can find things such as rent bills, a supermarket shop or an after-work pint. All of this across all 49 European countries. 

## Top 10 cheapest European countries

### Rent and bills

This research reveals that the cheapest country to relocate to is North Macedonia counting a cost of just £8,484 for a year. You can buy a pint for as little as £1.49 and enjoy lunch for £5.85, whilst a full year’s rent is expected to cost just £2,496 for a standard 2-bedroom apartment.

### Socialising

Another very interesting aspect they tackled is the list of top 10 cheapest European countries for socialising. What does this mean? These are costs more related to the social life, whatever it is going our for a cup of coffee or a pint, lunch away, cinema tickests, a restaurant meal or cocktail. They also covered the price of a night out for two.

Here following a bit more data.
