What comes to your mind when you think of Australia? For most of us, Australia is reminiscent of kangaroos, the opera house, and the barrier reef. And perhaps also of koalas and the famous Australian team. Yes, these are definitely the places and things that entice people when they think of Australia.

But if you are planning to head to Australia, then you need not be stuck with just these few places and things. Because Australia is much more than this! Yes, not only there are many places to visit but also you could choose from a variety of options such as short city breaks, nature trails, and hiking, and so much more. You can opt for laid back barbeque afternoons or some sports commending an adrenaline rush. Alternatively, go for long coastal drives and enjoy the beauty of the landscape. Basically, first, you need to make up your mind on what to do in Australia and then plan likewise.

## Let's look at a few to-do’s that are worth to make your visit to Australia an ideal trip:

**\#1 Canberra**

Canberra is Australia’s inland capital. It is also known as the ‘Bush Capital’. Canberra is popular for its luscious forests, farmlands and nature reserves. An interesting thing about this city is the Lake Burley Griffin which is the heart and soul of the place and is frequented by adventurers interested in sailing and kayaking. Make sure to keep yourself hydrated; carry water in a very convenient way through water carriers like rotopax which allow you to carry gallons of water at a go.

Apart from adventure spot, the city also portrays the country’s historical and cultural aspect. It consists of monuments and galleries which recall excellent moments of Australia’s historical exploits. Some of the must-see places include the Parliament House, the Australian War Memorial, the National Gallery of Australia and Questacon and the Tidnbinbilla Nature Reserve or The Australian Alps. Some seasonal festivals include the Balloon Fiesta in autumn, the Fireside Festival in winter, and the Floriade in spring.

**\#2 Sydney**

Sydney (also known as Harbour City) is the country’s oldest city. It is also one of the most culturally diverse city. The popular Opera House belongs to this city. Other than that, there are many parks and architectural attractions which make this city special. Some of the attractions of this city are Sydney Harbour Bridge and Darling Harbour, the Australian Museum and the Museum of Sydney, the Rocks, and the Skywalk.

**\#8 Gold Coast**

This is an ideal getaway for all you surfers and also has a few theme parks which would give you fun and frolic time.

## The best time to travel to Australia:

Australia has a big geographic area and every area experiences its own seasons. So it would be helpful if you research about the seasonal variations and the ideal time to plan what to do in Australia. Sydney is one such city which can be visited all year around.

North Australia (Darwin area) is not a good idea in Australian summer as it is also the wet season and the roads are often impassible. The best time to visit North Australia is from May to October when summer is not at its peak.

Places such as Melbourne, Adelaide, Tasmania, etc. are best visited in the warmer months. Queensland is warm all year round while the best time to visit south-western Australia is in spring or autumn.

## Tip:

Australia is not only a big continent but also diverse in flora, fauna, culture and in spatial terms. It is not possible to visit each and every part of the continent if you go just for a few days. So either you would want to plan a long vacation or selectively visit certain places based on what to do in Australia. Driving around the continent in itself is convenient and using fj cruiser roof racks makes it all the more comfortable. Though driving around is a convenient option when in Australia, do keep in mind that within continent flights to skip long hours of travelling are also available.
