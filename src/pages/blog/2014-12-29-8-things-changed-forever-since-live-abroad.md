_**Living abroad**_ is an amazing experience, but it has some drawback with it. Things change, and so do you.

You start looking at the past and thinking about it, how everything has changed, and how you changed too. We did the same and chose the 8 most important things that changed in our life after moving abroad here we go.<!--more-->

## 1. You feel suddenly free.

Yes, freedom is one of the most amazing feelings you have when travelling. _**Living abroad**_ isn't so different and even if you know you have always been free, this is a different feeling. You wanted to make an experience abroad and you did it, now you are aware of what you can achieve and you know you can achieve everything else you want.

## 2. Adrenaline pumping in your veins.

Living in a different country gives you adrenaline. _**Visiting new places**_ and meeting new people makes everything so exciting. You will not fear to start from "**scratch**", instead you will have the need to keep on doing it, like an addiction. That's adrenaline.

## 3 Language confusion.

If you live abroad for a while, you will probably learn the language. At some point, it will come so natural that you will be confused with your native language, mixing words and sentences. Don't worry you will get used .. maybe ðŸ™‚

## 4. Nostalgia? Homesickness?

C'mon, we know it .. it happens to almost everyone. There is a moment when you start feeling a bit homesick, you miss your friends or family. It happens suddenly, maybe watching a movie, listening to a song or just seeing a random image in the street.Â  No worries, y*ou learn how to deal with it.*

## 5. Lack of words .. or maybe you've got too many in mind

There is so much to say about your experience and they way you feel, that you would like to share your feelings with the world. But you can't find the right words. Too many things at once running in your mind and in your heart. Sometimes, it is difficult to express some feelings, you can try but living them in person is something completely different.

## 6. Nothing changes at home

When you live abroad you have your own life, while at home everything stays the same. This is what you think, but everytime you go back home you realize how things change while you are not there. You think nothing changes, but everyone else life goes on without you.

## 7. Bravery, yes or not?

Some people tell you that you were brave enough to leave everything and get this chance, your chance abroad. The thing is that, they don't understand that the bravery is just a tiny little part of the whole decision. It is their will that will make the difference! If they want to try, no one can stop them, they can just get their chance like you did. It2s up to them!

## 8. You change.

It might sound like a clichÃ¨, but it's the truth: you change, an experience like this will change who you are. You won't realize it at the beginning, but when the time passes by you will see it more clearly. It's like a puzzle that you have to match the pieces one by one and step by step. You grew up, have scars and, much more, you live your life.
