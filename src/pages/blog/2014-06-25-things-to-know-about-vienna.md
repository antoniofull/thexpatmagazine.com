**Vienna** is a beautiful city and every year ranks on top of all the competitions about the best city in the world or with the best quality of life. Here a list of things you should be aware if you move there for work or even just for travel, we collected the most important.<!--more-->

### 1 **About one fourth of the population of Austria lives in the capital, Vienna.**Â Austria has about 8.5 million of inhabitants, and 1.7 million (2.4 million including the metropolitan area) live in Vienna. So this city takes about 1/4 of all the country! You will notice this Â as soon as you arrive with traffic jam and public transport always busy.

### **3 Vienna was divided after the world war in 4 parts, each one lead by Russia, United States, France and Britain and each of them imposed different rules for the zones, Â leaving only the first district international and free. In October 1955 Austria was finallyÂ re-established as a sovereign state.**

- When using public transport or in aÂ escalator always stay on your right, seriously do not occupy the left Â side, is for runners and rushers!
- Like culture and do not talk about politics and the past (you know what we mean).
- Prostitution is legal ( Just if you were wondering ðŸ™‚ ).
