Every year they release a report which list the **World&#8217;s safest airlines**, judged based on different factors which include, obviously, the **number of accidents and casualties** but also the audit from the **aviationâ€™s governing bodies** and lead associations; **government audits**; airlineâ€™s crash and serious incident record; **profitability and fleet age**.

Based on this list of criteria airline ratings compiles the list of the **World&#8217;s safest airlines** and, for the fourth year in a row, there is a company who is leading this list for 2017, the Australian airlineÂ **Qantas**.

This company holds the first place again this year, but also holds the record of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no casualties during its flights</span>, which is very impressive. Anyway there are also other **19 companies** together with them, and we have listed them all Â inÂ alphabetical order.
