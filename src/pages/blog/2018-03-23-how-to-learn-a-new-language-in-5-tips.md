When you decide to move to an other country, you have to consider various things and facts to settle down the way you wish. Most of the time next to the administrational checks, if you really want to feel home and live the new place at your best, you also need to **learn the local language**. I &#8216;m going to share with you **5 tips** to include in your daily routine on how to learn a new language easily and fast.

### Tutors and standard lessons

Let&#8217;s start from the classic and most used method to approach a new language: standard classes and tutors. In this category you can find a huge variety of opportunities, including local language schools or online tutors. The most professional ones will asset your language skills at the beginning, in order to appoint you to the right course, and give you a certificate at the end of it. Language schools such as Dante Alighieri and Babel can be found almost in every city, but there are many other schools ready to offer the skills you are looking for.

### Duolingo & apps

Have you ever tried apps to learn a new language? I have used Duolingo myself and I found it very useful, it is friendly user, **easy and handy**. I suggest to use it on a daily basis, 10 minutes per day are enough, you can do it while sitting in the train on the way back from work, or before going to sleep. It helps to train your brain, learn new words and be on track on your learning schedule.

### Movies

I know what you&#8217;re thinking right now: how am I supposed to watch a movie if I&#8217;m not able to understand everything they say? Good point my friend, but why don&#8217;t you challenge yourself by trying it out? **Our brain needs to learn through new ways and methods**, it may feel difficult at the beginning but trust me, little by little your mind will get used to it and learn without even realising it. My suggestion is to watch movies in original languages, starting with subtitles in the original language (for example: if you&#8217;re learning Spanish, the subtitles need to be in Spanish too), when you feel more confident you can remove the subtitles at all. It&#8217;s normal if you won&#8217;t understand every single word, but thanks to the scenes and images you will still understand what is going on.

### Language Exchange

Alright, so far we have had options to train reading and listening, but what about **speaking**? Once you have learned the basics of the language, it is important to practice even more and do it face to face. There are a lot of websites or Facebook groups to look for language exchange tandem, an example is [Conversationexchange,][1] Â hereÂ you can help other people learning your native language, while you learn theirs too. One very important advice for you: don&#8217;t be scared of failing, just try and speak! Perfection doesn&#8217;t exist, even less when you are learning something new. ðŸ˜‰

### Books

Reading books is the last but not least tip you can use when you&#8217;re more confident with the new language. When I read my first book in an other language, I was so eager that I wanted to understand every single word, so I had to look them up on the dictionary&#8230; the thing is that my enthusiasm fade away little by little, because I did not enjoy the reading. So, once I knew a bit more about the language a gave it a try again and promised not to look up for all the words I didn&#8217;t know the meaning of, as long as I could understand the story and the context. Guess what? It went much better after that, and I got more and more fluent, and proud of myself too.
