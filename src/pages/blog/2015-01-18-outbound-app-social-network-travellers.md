We had finally the opportunity to test the new app <a href="https://www.outboundapp.org"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Outbound</a>, released just few days ago. I can say I was quite excited to give it a tryÂ as finally we can have a sort of social network dedicated only to travellers. (I'm personally not a big fan of Facebook)

The app is for free and is downloadable from the _**app store**_ or _**Play Store**_ directly, just head to the main site and click on your favorite store to download it. I tried the iphone app.

At the beginning the _registration takes a_ while, including loading the database for the first time. But this is a good sign as there are almost 1 million of travellers registered.

After registering a new profile, I used the email option, but it's possible to register with Facebook which should be faster, the app loads your profile page.

The first 2 things I liked from the app :

### 1 Wifi Spots.

On the top left of the profile page.

Yes, just one click and is possible to look for free wifi hotspots around you.

### 2 It is possible to create events.

This is a very nice feature. Events are a very good way to socialise especially for solo travellers, like me. I see that the feature is not widely used yet, but it might be a very good one.

The bottom menu, apart of events and profile page, presents also other features like explore, Â search and noticeboard.

### Explore.

Explore trips around you or in a country of your choice. You can see who's planning where.

### Search.

You can searchÂ people around you, see their profile and look at their planned trips and trip history. This is a feature similar to many others app indeed. What is good is that most of the profile look real not spammy robots or fake profiles.

### Â NoticeBoard.

For what I understood this is like a board where people can leave tips for the country. Seems good but when I tried to see it worldwide the app asked me to invite 3 Facebook friends to be able to see it, as I did not invite my friends I cannot say anything about this feature.

You can of course add travellers as friends and then interact with them.

### Conclusions.

Is a nice app, with a couple of features that might come very handy for many travellers.

The graphic interfacce in general can be improved for a better **User Experience** and having some "helpers" to understand how some of the functionality work would be better.

But in general is a good app, it deserves a try. Â ðŸ™‚

Did you try this app? Let us know what you think in the comments ðŸ˜€
