title: Emma Duncan
bio: Emma is a linguist by day and a hopeless daydreamer, also by day. After
  having lived in a handful of European countries and mostly failing to learn
  the languages of each, she is now on a mission to crack the code of language
  learning for people of average intelligence and motivation like herself.
