  Having grown up in Georgia most of her life, Melissa always had an itch to see
  the world. She ventured off to Sao Paulo, Brazil in 1998 to live for 2 years.
  No stranger to international living, in 2017, when an opportunity arose again
  to move to London, she embraced it with open arms. Melissa is now studying a
  Master's degree in advertising and PR at Richmond, The American International
  University in London while living the London life.
