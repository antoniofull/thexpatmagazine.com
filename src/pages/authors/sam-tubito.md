bio: I am a global nomad. A 4th generation global nomad to be precise. I've
  lived in 14 countries, 18 cities. So far. I speak Italian, French and English
  fluently and have learned 4 more along the way. I've visited 38 countries. For
  me, Home isn't one particular place; home is constantly changing and
  ultimately where the heart is.
