bio: >-
  My name is Leila, and I am a 30-something expat living in Beijing, China. One
  day I decided that I wanted to see the world off of screens and in real life,
  so I set off a world away. I love discovering new places, meeting locals and
  trying all the food there is to offer. If you like to wonder, come with me and
  let's explore this beautiful planet together.
