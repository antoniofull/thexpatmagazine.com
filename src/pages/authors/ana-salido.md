bio: "Ana Salido is a Life Coach, Psychologist and entrepreneur on a mission to help women to make their expatriation a successful project. After different jobs in France, she decided in 2015 to leave France for Australia, and she has created her own brand since.\_She wanted to combine her Psychology degree with her experience as an expat to support and empower others to follow the same path she took, so it was the beginning of Expat Infinity. Expat Infinity is not just for expats or future expats, it’s for all people who want to live their lives without worrying about what others think, it’s for people who have dreams and wish to reach them, but it is also for all expats who ask themselves many questions and face many challenges in their new lives."
